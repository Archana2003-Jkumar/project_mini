## AIM:
The aim of Data Shield is to enhance IoT database maintenance and security through the integration of machine intelligence, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability in the Internet of Things ecosystem.

## THEOREY:

## PROCEDURE:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather necessary data, such as system activity logs, network traffic logs, and other security-related information.
Handle missing values, scale or normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables as part of the preprocessing step of the data.

2. Feature Selection:
Determine and select features that are important for anomaly detection and security monitoring.

3. Training Data Preparation:
Make a training dataset that mostly consists of normal cases to illustrate typical system behavior.

4. Model Training:
a. Isolation Forest:
Utilizing the prepared training dataset, train the isolation forest model.

b. Local Outlier Factor (LOF):
Utilizing the training data, train the LOF model.

c. Autoencoders:
Utilizing the training dataset, train the autoencoder model.

5. Anomaly Detection:
a. Isolation Forest:
Utilize the complete dataset with the learned isolation forest model.
Shorter travel lengths should be noted as possible anomalies.

b. Local Outlier Factor (LOF):
Using the dataset, apply the learned LOF model.
Lower local density instances should be noted as potential anomalies.

c. Autoencoders:
Reconstruct the input data using the trained autoencoder.
For every instance, determine the reconstruction error.
Determine whether cases have huge reconstruction mistakes and mark them as possible anomalies.

6. Threshold Setting:
Determine a threshold for reconstruction mistakes or anomaly scores by using domain expertise or validation data.
Outliers are those instances that go outside of the norm.

8. Integration with Security Infrastructure:
The outlier detection system should be incorporated into the larger security framework.
Initiate real-time monitoring to discover anomalies continuously.

8. Alerting and Response:
Implement a system that will send out warnings or alerts in the event that possible outliers are detected.
Establish a response strategy to look into and address security threats that the outlier detection system has found.

9. Regular Model Evaluation and Updating:
Analyze the models' performance on a regular basis with new data.
To adjust to modifications in the system and data patterns, update the models as necessary.

10. Documentation and Reporting:
Keep records of the processes, model configurations, and outcomes.
Provide periodical reports that highlight significant discoveries and the effectiveness of outlier detection.
